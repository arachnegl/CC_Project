\section{Motivation}

It is becoming increasingly important to better manage electricity consumption. Domestic electri- city prices in the UK increased by 35 (in real terms) between 2003 and 2011 [15]. Energy price rises alone are projected to inflate the UK consumer prices index by 1.5 \% in Q4 2011 [17], making energy one of the most dominant upward forces acting on UK consumer prices. This upward price trend is likely to continue as global energy demand, especially from non-OECD countries, contin- ues to grow. In 2000, China used half as much energy as the USA. In 2009, China overtook the USA to become the world’s largest energy user [11]. The International Energy Agency projects that Chinese consumption will increase by 75\% between 2008 and 2035, and that Indian energy consumption will more than double over the same period (although India will still consume less energy in 2035 than either the USA or China) [11].
The UK is especially exposed to energy price rises. The UK makes extensive use of natural gas for heat and power generation. Between 1995 and 2004 the UK was not just self-sufficient for gas but it was also a net exporter of natural gas pumped from the North Sea [20]. Gas production from the North Sea peaked and began its terminal decline in 2000 hence the UK has been a net importer since 2004 [20], requiring us to buy increasing amounts of gas on the volatile global market. Gas production from the North Sea halved between 2000 and 2010

I thought I was being clever in stripping out the extra information, but it turns out that a full datestamp makes the code clearer and I should have left the full datestamp.
